## The Question

Posterior inference: suppose you have a $Beta(4, 4)$ prior distribution on the probability $\theta$
that a coin will yield a ‘head’ when spun in a specified manner. The coin is independently
spun ten times, and ‘heads’ appear fewer than 3 times. You are not told how many heads
were seen, only that the number is less than 3. Calculate your exact posterior density
(up to a proportionality constant) for $\theta$ and sketch it.
